* RoboJackets Virtual Machine Setup Guide

Scroll to the bottom for Docker setup.

This document will help you get started using the RoboJackets Software Virtualbox Image

1. Install VirtualBox

   Install VirtualBox from the [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox downloads page]].

2. If you are on Windows ensure you have Virtualization turned on in your BIOS

   If you are on a Mac you should not need to do this.
   If you are on Windows [[http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/][This]] is a simple guide of how to do this.
   While this is not 100% necessary, it will make your VM *much* faster.

   On a Windows host, you may need to turn off Hyper-V as well.

3. Get a Copy of the built Image

   First start by downloading the [[https://cloud.robojackets.org/f/342830][prebuilt image]].

4. Import Image into VirtualBox

   1. Go to =File->Import Appliance=

   2. Select the =.ova= file you downloaded earlier

   3. Check the Amount of Memory and CPU's

      Increase the Memory/CPU to your computer's specs. Don't allocate too much memory/cpus or it will cause severe performance issues.
      (A good rule of thumb is half of your overall memory if you have at least 4 GB and half of your total CPU's)

   4. Hit =Import=!
      
5. Boot your new VM

   Double Click the Entry, or Right Click -> Start -> Normal Start

6. Credentials

   |---------+----------|
   | User    | Password |
   |---------+----------|
   | vagrant | vagrant  |
   |---------+----------|

   The sudo password is =vagrant=.

7. You Made It! :tada:
    If you are having issues see the troubleshooting section below
    
** Troubleshooting Steps

1. If you get =Unable to import OVA with error NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG= it could be caused by not having enough hard drive space to unpack the image.

2. If you get a =Kernel Driver not installed= error try the instructions here: https://www.howtogeek.com/658047/how-to-fix-virtualboxs-%E2%80%9Ckernel-driver-not-installed-rc-1908-error/

3. Check the Virtual Machine Settings
    1. If you are getting a black screen when attempting to run gazebo or other 3D applications try disabling 3D Acceleration by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =Display= tab and uncheck the =Enable 3D Acceleration= box. 
    2. If you are having other graphical issues check how much VRAM is allocated by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =Display= tab and confirm that =VRAM= is set to 128 MB and the =Enable 3D Acceleration= checkbox is checked. 
        
    3. Check to see if too much memory/cpu's have been allocated to the virtual machine by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =System= tab and check that the=Memory= slider on the =Motherboard= tab is set to around half of your total system RAM. Finally, go to the =Processor= tab and check that the =Processor(s)= slider is set to between 1 and half of your total system CPU cores and that the =Exectuion Cap= is set to 100%.
    

* RoboJackets Docker Image Setup Guide

If you would prefer to use Docker (or your computer does not support VirtualBox) follow this guide.

1. Download Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. In your terminal run: `docker pull thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training`
3. Run `docker run  --rm -p 6080:80 -p 6081:443 --mount source=rj-training-home,destination=/home/padowan --mount source=rj-training-usr,destination=/usr -e USER=padowan -e PASSWORD=robojackets --name training thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training -h training`.
4. Navigate to `localhost:6080` in your browser and wait (it may take a while).
5. Start training! You will also have access to the repos for robonav, roboracing, and robocup.
6. Anytime password is needed fill in with `robojackets` or whatever you put as the argument to the environment variable in step 3.

If the above does not work on you computer, you can replace steps 2 and three with:
2. `docker pull thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training:m1`
3. Run `docker run  --rm -p 5900:5900 --mount source=rj-training-home,destination=/home/padowan --mount source=rj-training-usr,destination=/usr -e USER=padowan -e PASSWORD=robojackets --name training thecharlesjenkins/robojackets-software-training:m1 -h training`
4. Use a VNC viewer to navegate to localhost:5900. On Safari you can do `vnc://localhost:5900`
