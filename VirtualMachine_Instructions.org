* RoboJackets Virtual Machine Setup Guide

This document will help you get started using the RoboJackets Software Virtualbox Image

1. Install VirtualBox

   Install VirtualBox from the [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox downloads page]].

2. If you are on Windows ensure you have Virtualization turned on in your BIOS

   If you are on a Mac you should not need to do this.
   If you are on Windows [[http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/][This]] is a simple guide of how to do this.
   While this is not 100% necessary, it will make your VM *much* faster.

   On a Windows host, you may need to turn off Hyper-V as well.

3. Get a Copy of the built Image

   First start by downloading the [[https://mirror.robojackets.org/software_training_fall_2021.ova][prebuilt image]].

4. Import Image into VirtualBox

   1. Go to =File->Import Appliance=

   2. Select the =.ova= file you downloaded earlier

   3. Check the Amount of Memory and CPU's

      Increase the Memory/CPU to your computer's specs. Don't allocate too much memory/cpus or it will cause severe performance issues.
      (A good rule of thumb is half of your overall memory if you have at least 4 GB and half of your total CPU's)

   4. Hit =Import=!
      
5. Boot your new VM

   Double Click the Entry, or Right Click -> Start -> Normal Start

6. Credentials

   |---------+----------|
   | User    | Password |
   |---------+----------|
   | robojackets | robojackets  |
   |---------+----------|

   The sudo password is =vagrant=.

7. You Made It! :tada:
    If you are having issues see the troubleshooting section below
    
** Troubleshooting Steps

1. If you get =Unable to import OVA with error NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG= it could be caused by not having enough hard drive space to unpack the image.

2. If you get a =Kernel Driver not installed= error try the instructions here: https://www.howtogeek.com/658047/how-to-fix-virtualboxs-%E2%80%9Ckernel-driver-not-installed-rc-1908-error/

3. Check the Virtual Machine Settings
    1. If you are getting a black screen when attempting to run gazebo or other 3D applications try disabling 3D Acceleration by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =Display= tab and uncheck the =Enable 3D Acceleration= box. 
    2. If you are having other graphical issues check how much VRAM is allocated by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =Display= tab and confirm that =VRAM= is set to 128 MB and the =Enable 3D Acceleration= checkbox is checked. 
        
    3. Check to see if too much memory/cpu's have been allocated to the virtual machine by right clicking the virtualbox entry and hitting =Settings=. Then, go to the =System= tab and check that the=Memory= slider on the =Motherboard= tab is set to around half of your total system RAM. Finally, go to the =Processor= tab and check that the =Processor(s)= slider is set to between 1 and half of your total system CPU cores and that the =Exectuion Cap= is set to 100%.
