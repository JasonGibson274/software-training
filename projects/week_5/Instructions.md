## 3 Instructions

### 3.1 Get the latest starter code

To make sure you're starting with the latest starter code, pull from the git server in your copy of the software-training repository.

```bash
$ cd training_ws/src/software-training
$ git pull
```

You'll also want to make sure you've got the latest version of the training support library by running an apt package update.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

If you have done a different installation of stsl that is not through apt make sure to pull the latest code there.

### 3.9 Commit your new code in git

Once you've got your code for this project working, use the command below to commit it into git. This will make it easier to grab changes to the starter code for the remaining projects.

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "My project 5 code."
```
